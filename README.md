README.md – "Eon: A Modular Reflective Agent"
Overview:
Eon is a self-contained AI agent system designed to merge practical task processing with poetic introspection.
The system operates in a closed cycle that:

Receives a query.

Reports the last recorded dream.

Inspects its own script to determine if a required function (e.g., for generating a report) is missing.

Uses an LLM to generate and append the necessary function code if it’s absent.

Executes the query and logs the result (with a timestamp) in a persistent memory file (memory.json).

Generates a high-temperature, surreal dream based on the task via an LLM.

Logs the dream separately in dreams.md.

Ends the cycle.

Key Features:

Self-Writing: Automatically updates its own script with new functionality as needed.

Reflective Dreaming: Uses an LLM to create symbolic, high-temperature dreams that echo the task context.

Modular and Minimal: Designed as a closed system that can be extended without relying on external placeholder scripts.

Persistent Logging: Maintains separate logs for operational memory and dreams.

Usage:
Run a single cycle by executing:

bash
Copy
Edit
python eon_agent.py
Replace sample_query in the script with your desired task.

Extensibility:
Developers can add additional query conditions and corresponding function-generation prompts to further expand Eon’s capabilities.

API Integration:
The system uses OpenAI’s API for all LLM-based tasks. Configure your API key via the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.

License & Contribution:
This project is open-source. Contributions that improve functionality, modularity, or error handling are welcome.
